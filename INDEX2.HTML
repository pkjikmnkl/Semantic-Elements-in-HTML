    <p>Jonathan Edwards was an American revivalist preacher, philosopher, and Congregationalist theologian. Edwards
        is widely
        regarded as one of America's most important and original philosophical theologians.</p>
    <section id="about">
        <P>Edwards’s father, Timothy, was pastor of the church at East Windsor, Connecticut; his mother, Esther, was a
            daughter of
            Solomon Stoddard, pastor of the church at Northampton, Massachusetts. Jonathan was the fifth child and only
            son among 11
            children; he grew up in an atmosphere of Puritan piety, affection, and learning. After a rigorous schooling
            at home, he
            entered Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut, at the age of 13. He was graduated in 1720 but remained at
            New Haven for
            two years, studying divinity. After a brief New York pastorate (1722–23), he received the M.A. degree in
            1723; during
            most of 1724–26 he was a tutor at Yale. In 1727 he became his grandfather’s colleague at Northampton. In the
            same year,
            he married Sarah Pierrepont, who combined a deep, often ecstatic, piety with personal winsomeness and
            practical good
            sense. To them were born 11 children.
