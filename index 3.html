        <p>Saitama (Japanese: サイタマ) is a fictional titular protagonist of the Japanese manga and anime series One-Punch
            Man created
            by One. An unaffiliated superhero from Z-City who dreams of fame and performs heroic acts as a hobby</p>
        <section id="about">
            <p>For three years straight, Saitama had trained enough to become the strongest being that can defeat any
                enemy with a
                single punch. However, his overwhelming power leaves him without real challenges, leading to boredom and
                a sense of
                emptiness. He becomes the reluctant mentor of Genos, a cybornetic hero seeking revenge on the one who
                killed his family
                and destroyed his hometown, after Saitama saves him from a powerful monster. Through Genos, Saitama
                learns about the
                Hero Association, a professional organization that combats monsters and protects the Earth.</p>
